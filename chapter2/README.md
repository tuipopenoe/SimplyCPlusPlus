# Chapter 2

## Skills
    * Compile .h and .cpp files using GCC 
    g++ -o <output file name> <file to be compiled>
    * Include C++ Standard Library Files and use classes, functions and objects
    * Use `cout` (output stream object) followed by << 
    (stream insertion operator) and the string of characters to be displayed
    * Use the newline escape sequence \n or endl
    * Insert comments in code using // or /* */
    * Locate syntax errors using compiler output
## Key Terms
    * (#) preprocessor operator - operator that must being each statement that 
    is processed by the C++ preprocessor.
    * binary operator - operator that requires two operands
    * body of a function - group of statements contained inside a function { }
    * case sensitive - property of a language that determines between 
    uppercase and lowercase letters in code
    * `cin` (standard input stream) - object that retrieves keyboard input
    * comment - text in source code file that increases code readability by
    explaining the code. Comments are ignored by the compiler.
    * compilation error - An error detected by the compiler, such as a syntax
    error
    * `cout` (standard output stream) - Object that displays text
    * cursor - the current screen position indicator
    * debugger - Software that allows the monitoring the execution of
     applications to locate and remove logic errors
    * debugging - the process of locating and correcting errors in an 
    application
    * end-of-line comment - comment at the end of a line, following a statement
    * entry point - the location in an application's source code where 
    execution begins. In C++, the entry point is the `main()` function
    * escape character - the character that begins an escape sequence
    * executable statement - statement that performs an action
    * forward slash character - two consecutive forward slashes mark a comment
    * full-line comment - comment that starts at the beginning of a line
    * function - a program building block consisting of a name, return type, 
    comma separated list of paramters declartions, and executable statements 
    enclosed in braces { }
    * input/output stream header file <iostream> - a file that provides basic
    stream input/output services. This file must be declared to use 
    `cout`/`cin`
    * integrated development environment (IDE) - application that enables a 
    programmer to create, run and debug applications.
    * keyword - a word that is reserved for use by C++ and cannot be used to 
    create new identifiers
    * left brace (}) - indicates the beginning of a block of code
    * left operand - An expression that appears on the left side of a binary 
    operator
    * literal - A sequence of characters within double quotes
    * logic error - An error that does not prevent the application from 
    compiling successfully, but does cause erroneous results
    * `main` - The function that every C++ application executes when first 
    started. Every C++ application must have exactly one `main` function
    * newline character (\n) - Moves cursor to the beginning of the next line
    * operand - An expression that is combined with an operator to perform a 
    task
    * operator - A symbol or pair of symbols that causes an application to 
    perform a task by applying the operator to its operands
    * preprocessor - A program that performs manipulations on the application's
    source code before the compiler's translation phase begins.
    * preprocessor directive - Message to the compiler's preprocessor. 
    * project - group of files containing source code and instructions for 
    building the application
    * reserved word - A word that is reserved for use by C++ and cannot be 
    used to create new identifiers.
    * right brace (}) - A symbol that indicates the end of a block of code
    * right operand - An expression that appears on the right side of a binary
    operator
    * semicolon(;) - the character used to indicate the end of a C++ statement
    * statement - Code that instructs the computer to perform a task. Most 
    statements in C++ end with a semicolon (;) character
    * stream insertion operator (<<) - The operator that sends characters to a
    stream object such as `cout`. The stream object must be specified to the 
    left of the operator, characters must be to the right of the operator
    * stream of characters - A sequence of characters passed to a stream 
    object such as `cout` or input from a stream object such as `cin`
    * string - a sequence of characters
    * string constant - A sequence of characters within double quotes
    * string literal - A sequence of characters within double quotes
    * syntax error - A compilation error that occurs when code violates the 
    grammar of a programming language. Syntax errors are detected by the 
    compiler
    * `using` directive - A directive that notifies the compiler that the 
    application will use services from the specified namespace
    * whitespace character - A newline, space, or tab character
